# Autoencoding 

Autoencoding is the attempt to compress data to a lower latent dimensional space from which points can be transformed to the higher dimensional space. This directory contains code that attempts different forms of autoencoding on the skethcy dataset to create a generative latent space that can be used to compress and create new drawings.
