# Sketchy experiments
Accompanying code for experiments carried out with the Sketchy dataset. First, download the Sketchy dataset [here](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) to use this code. 

### Pixel N-grams
Experiments completed with N-grams trained on pixel values from the Sketchy dataset to create new images. Spoiler alert: they don't look like sketches at all. 

### Sonification
Experiments in sonifying n-gram generated images and mean images of different classes of objects in the Sketchy dataset.

### Autoencoding
Experiments in autoencoding all the sketches in the dataset to create a latent space that can represent the drawings.
